Download a Youtube mp3 fast and efficient. Make a excel list and download

Purpose: 
To download a list of YouTube URL's fast and efficient into mp3. 

How to:
Create virutal enviroment and install the requirements from the requirements.txt file. 

Have the python file and the excel file with which you want to download the songs in the same folder. 

The excel file can have multipule columns with different names (see exampel), however remember to name the column you are using correctly as this is the column in which the URL's are to be put in. 

OBS: Things to change in the python code. 
1. The name of the excel file you are using.
2. The column in which your URL's are in.
3. The output path.

I have attached an exampel excel-file which matches the input and output of the code. 

!! HAVE FUN !!
